So here I'm just placing a hope into a bird, 
Aimlessly I'm waiting for my message to be heard, 
I'm locked in the tower, I write her everyday, 
But lacked of dream I had the notes are lost along the way, 
And all my hope it fades like vapor, as I tear of this final sheet of paper, 
Please, I'm counting on your speed, just find a way to finally get me free.

But if I were king of the world, I'd be the crazy fool, 
To go and give it all away, just to be next to you, 
And how the people say, "Oh, he's so unbelievable!" 
Maybe I wouldn't be so invisible if I were the king of the world. 

Down, 
Down, 
Down, 
Come the tears, 

When everything I ever had all comes down to this, 
Well I was happy once, with all the life and love I found, 
But jealousy rose in the eyes of the king, whose lack of love, just tortured him, 
He locked me in a tower, and told her that I died, 
And ever since I've been inside, 

Back to REFF;
